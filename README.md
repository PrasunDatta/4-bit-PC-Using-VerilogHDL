# 4-bit-PC-Using-VerilogHDL
This project is mainly focused on the course - "EEE 415 Microprocessors and Embedded Systems". Here we have designed a 4 bit PC using VerilogHDL.

## Abstract

<p align = "justify" >
4 bit pc is a very basic model of a microprocessor which is motivated by
SAP(simple-as-possible-1) architecture explained by Malvino. 4 bit pc accomplishes all its
instruction using 4 bit computing method.In computer architecture, 4-bit integers, memory
addresses, or other data units are those that are 4 bits wide. Also, 4-bit CPU and ALU
architectures are those that are based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size. A
group of four bits is also called a nibble and has 24 = 16 possible values. Its primary purpose is
to develop a basic understanding of how a microprocessor works, interacts with memory and
other parts of the system like input and output. The instruction set is very limited and is simple.</p>
